# City of Melbourne

Melbourne is the capital city of Victoria, and the second-largest city in Australia. 
The municipality  of Melbourne is around 37 km² and includes metropolitan Melbourne’s innermost suburbs, including the CBD area (City of Melbourne, 2022).

For this project I will explore several different datasets about the City of Melbourne to get  more details about the suburbs belong to this municipality. 
In particular, let’s imagine that I would like to potentially purchase an apartment in the City of Melbourne area. 
Therefore I want to know more about the pricing and other factors such as the safety or the number of cafes/restaurants/food services in each suburb.

Here I will use 3 datasets in total, including the following :
(These datasets are parts of the CLUE Open Data (The Census of Land Use and Employment) of City of Melbourne that provides infomation about land use, emplopyment and economic activity across 
the City of Melbourne.)

### Dataset 1: Victorian Property Sales Report - Median House by Suburb Time Series

https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/victorian-property-sales-report-median-house-bysuburb-time-series1
The data is compiled using information lodged every time a property sale is completed. It provides 
property statistics for Victoria’s 79 municipalities and yearly medians by suburb over a ten-year 
period (2010 - 2020)

### Datset 2: Cafes and restaurants - City of Melbourne

https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Business/Cafes-and-restaurants-with-seating-capacity/xt2ytnn9
The data covers the period 2002-2020 and shows business establishments with their business 
address, industry (ANZSIC4) classification, number of dining seats (classified by indoor/outdoor), 
location and CLUE block and small Suburb designation.

### Datset 3: Social Indicators for City of Melbourne Residents

The survey collects data about the state of health, well-being, participation and connection of 
communities in the Melbourne Local Government Suburb.These datasets provide indicator results 
of telephone and online surveys. Data is divided into suburb, gender and age groups and has been 
weighted according to population proportions.

The City of Melbourne Social Indicators Survey (CoMSIS) was conducted for the first time in 2018 
so I will get data from 3 separate reports for each year: 2018, 2019 and 2020.
